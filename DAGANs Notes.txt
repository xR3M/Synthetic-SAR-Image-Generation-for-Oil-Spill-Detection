Dense: Fully connected layer

7*7*128: 128 values to help to determine what to generate from input_dim

that 128 values is an array and will convert into it to have spatial qualities to create it into an image
7*7*128 will do this

Activation: will allow to caters for non-linearities in our model
NOTE: linear what activation functions do!!

Reshape:will convert 6272(7*7*128) into a format of (7,7,128)


Upsampling:

128 channels
Kernel size of 5x5
padding of the same so that it would not crop



Dropout layer sets some input units to zero in order to prevent overfitting, this is done so that the model 
doesnt start becoming overrelient on specific features

Must be careful when handling the dropout layer, a bad dropout layer may result in massive information loss and underfitting
